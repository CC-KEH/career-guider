To start the student on the “right track” the lectures and labs go beyond basic syntax by including best practices and object oriented programming idioms.  In addition the topics covered help prepare students for the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer SE 8 exam (a certification which demonstrates to potential employers a fundamental level of proficiency with the language).  However do note that this course is just as appropriate for someone who is not interested in taking the exam; if you want to learn Java this is the course for you!",

With digital photography though you can no longer take a great black and white photograph... but you can create one using the black and white photography techniques taught in this course. So if you're confused about which black and white conversion techniques to use unsure about how to adjust the tonal range and balance of your black and white photos using curves and masks want to make more of your black and white portraits and you want to learn how to tone your black and white images this course is for you. What black and white photography techniques are you going to learn:  \t* You're going to learn how to use a range of powerful flexible and non-destructive black and white conversion techniques. You're will learn which are the most useful and powerful e.g. the Channel Mixer and Black and White tool when to use one technique rather than another and which techniques to avoid (and why).   \t* You will learn how to evaluate the tonal range and tonal balance of an image and then how to make global and selective changes using adjustment layers selections masks and the Curves tool: four of the most powerful tools and techniques within Photoshop.   \t* You'll then learn how to use these tools and techniques to overcome some of the unique problems you'll face when converting your portraits to black and white including how to delineate your subject from the background how to work with skin tones to maximise detail or smooth your subject's skin and how to enhance your subject's eyes.   \t* You'll learn how to add unique and complex tones that will really bring your black and white images to life.   \t* You're going to learn how to embed all of these tools and techniques into a flexible powerful and repeatable  \tworkflow.   \t* But this isn't just a course about post-production and Photoshop: each video will also enable you to develop the skills and give you black and white photography tips you need to create not only technically optimal black and white photographs but ones that are aesthetically striking too.   \t* When you create a black and white image pressing the shutter is just the start.

This course starts by going over those concepts and then shows how to combine them for powerful results.  Rather than showing you every single feature this course focuses on the features people actually use without boring you to tears on the other tools.  The instructor Jeremy Shuback has taught over 150 000 people Photoshop and works as a professional designer. He uses Photoshop every day to create everything from billboards to photorealistic matte paintings for feature films. More importantly he understands that you don't want to spend 14 hours straight trying to learn Photoshop.",

Just like teaching to a grandmother j. we used lots of animations for them to be visualised in your mind.The only thing what you must do is watching the tutorials and making your own practises at home or a cafe with your imaginations.

      "description": "In the modern internet age delivering web content over a secure protocol has become essential. Since January 2017 Google attaches a warning label to any website that does not secure sensitive web page content by delivering it using HTTPS. This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames passwords credit cards and other sensitive information. In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured. Warning labels will become progressively more aggressive and eventually highlighted in red bold colors on the address bar. It is easy to see the consequences of not complying with this new requirement. You invest time money and energy to drive traffic to your website. Your users expect a secure browsing experience and will likely be deterred from using your page when they see such warning labels attached. There is a common misconception that securing a webpage over HTTPS requires expert server knowledge and is a costly and cumbersome process. The purpose of this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about HTTPS and SSL certificates. We start with the basics. Exploring the theory and definitions that will be useful in developing your understanding. From there we dive into configuring a server on Digital Ocean and installing a free SSL certificate known as Let's Encrypt. We also explore setting up Cron Jobs on an Ubuntu server to automatically renew your certificate periodically. After completing this course you will easily be able to secure any web page using HTTPS and free SSL certificates.",

We’ll take your natural intuition that society has told you to ignore and give you confidence through positive response based affirmation. Thereby imprinting verifiable intuitive data on the mind the same way muscle memory is created in Martial Arts sports or Ballet.  \t      \t\t\t\t\t    You’ll also come to understand that “Thinking” and “Knowing” are truly “counter-intuitive.”  \t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    The only known quantum computer in the Universe is the human brain. It receives over 20 million bits of information every single second yet only processes 15 thousand bits per second. We spend the vast majority of waking state editing out that information. It’s why people are so very tired at the end of the day even working a desk job. The level of concentration used just to block the massive amount of data streaming into the brain is hard work.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    What is all that other information?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Everything you’ve ever wanted to know about the past present or future. The Universe is a gossip that wants to tell you anything you want to know you just have to know how to listen and ask the right question. Just like doing a search on Google ask one way and get over a million different answers ask the same question a different way and *poof* what you want to know comes up.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    However in this case you and your brain are Google.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     In this course you’ll learn how to know anything about a person place thing or event anywhere in space/time. Here you will discover how to take your natural intuition and “turn it up to 11” through the scientifically proven skill. Commit a weekend to train your brain like others train for the Ironman race and your mind will start to work for you in ways you never realized were possible. Downloads provide you with all the material you'll need to print out. Bring a BLACK pen and your intuition.",

If you don't have to wait the club probably isn't poppin'. If you have to wait it's supposed to be worth the wait. But you and I don't like waiting in line and we don't like paying for cover either. I am an average guy who is an introvert by nature. However I realized that one gift that we introverts possess is the ability to intimately connect with people. We may not want everyone's attention but people actually feel comfortable when they are around you. So after learning that I could talk to strangers I slowly found myself on this journey of becoming a local promoter for an organization that promoted at high end clubs and ultra lounges in NY SF and LA. The techniques I'm teaching apply to clubs from exclusive 11pm-it's-busy-club to \"in-crowd-focused\" parties asian american clubs clubs with go-go dancers exclusive parties and other clubs.I'm sharing all my insider knowledge in this 1 HOUR CONDENSED BEAT THE SYSTEM hour course where I teach you exactly what to say to a BOUNCER PROMOTER and MANAGER at a nightclub. I will help you cut the line and skip the cover to get in for free. I'm a former nightclub promoter and an industry veteran who has been clubbing for the past 8 years. I hustled in college (graduated from a Top 20 School) promoted after school and partied into my late 20s. I've learned to develop social skills and phrases that help me get into the most exclusive clubs. And it's time to pass the baton and share my insights exact phrases tips lingo topic switchers and much more which will help you to RAPIDLY WIN the trust of the guardians of the club entrance and GAIN ACCESS to the club. Enjoy!P.S. I have credited the photographers and the club venues for the pictures used in this course. Please visit their websites and clubs if you are planning to go that destination! I have a list of all the places/websites you can check out (it's at the very last slide). If there is anything you would like me to remove please specify the course number and duration (i.e. 0:13).

      "description": "\tHTML 5 is the leading web development language nowadays. Those days are gone when HTML and CSS were enough to code a web page. Now the demand is high and though the competition. If you want to get a job in some IT company HTML 5 is one of the compulsory languages that every web development company expect from their employees. Or if you are a self-employed web developer then you are missing the world of innovation in HTML 5. \tWhat am I offering in this course?\tThere is a complete training of HTML 5 from Basic level to Advance degree in this course. In the starting at newbie level you will come to know about the essential elements we use in HTML and now in HTML 5. Then you will come to know what are the new features in this new version of the language and what is their use and where to use them. Afterwards you will come to know about developing your shapes by writing few lines of code. Then we will move to advance level in which you will learn to embed audios and videos in a professional way without any script and plugin. At the end of the course there is an extra section which is optional where you can learn about sockets and server sent events in a detailed way if you want to get deep in back end programming. \tWhy should I buy this course? I could get this information on google also.\tYou could get all the details of anything on the google. But you can't get all the required and important stuff at one place only. I mean you can get a lot of websites from where you can learn HTML 5 for free. But trust me they are like reading a book. They only say the function of an element and they write code on how it works. You will never get a practical knowledge. If you buy my course you can learn by watching me writing the codes and explaining the meaning of each and every line. Moreover if you stuck at any part of the course you have to post on various forums and then wait for members to get a solution. But here you have many other options. You could read our discussion threads to get your solution. You can start your discussion thread and I will be there to help you with the best option. You can even privately message or mail me with your difficulties and I am online most of the time so you don't have to wait a lot to get the solution. \tYou can read the curriculum to know more about the topics covering in this course. Plus there is an option for all my students to get items on demand. You can write me and I will publish it for you.  \tHope to see you inside.",

There is about an hour of video lecture which covers exposure aperture shutter speed and the mode dial (Auto P S or TV A or Av and M). Images will be shown as examples. The exercises will be explained fully. This course is perfect for anyone who considers themselves a beginner with their camera or for anyone who has some existing knowledge about how their camera works but hasn't quite put all the puzzle pieces together when it comes to how aperture and shutter speed work together. This class is for you if you don't know how all the modes (Auto P S or TV A or Av and M) work on your camera and when you should be using each mode.",

The course begins with the very basics of the Unity interface and progresses to an in-depth examination of all the mecanim components including the Animation Animator DopeSheet and Curve windows. The majority of lectures are follow-along hands-on workshops in which the student will explore a variety of animation techniques from creating a simple bouncing ball through to a complex animation for a wall climbing character. Animated models and starter projects are included for students who are not confident in creating their own.  By the end of this course the student will have thoroughly explored the functionality of the mecanim system under the instruction of an internationally recognised university professor and be well on their way to developing snippets of code to control all aspects of 3d game animation.",

At the same time I will present you the OpenCSV library so that we will have our data in a csv-format and from those files we will populate the tables within the database. We will have our mock data only of course as your app needs to be unique - so it will be up to you to think for the questions and their answers.

After this course you will notice how your language has changed and how you will be able to express yourself in a different way. All you have to do is to listen to the videos more than one time-that’s why I made them so short- that’s how you'll never forget those idioms.

This course brings together a wide variety of lessons learned from Dr. Dunbar's training as a veterinarian a scientific researcher an animal behaviorist a professional dog trainer and a young boy growing up on an English farm.  \t  \tThis seminar will focus on many principles and methods that have  been scientifically proven in the research lab and then adapted for the  real-world environment and the many constraints that exist when a family of novices trains a pet dog in their home.  \t  \t  And just because his methods are supported by science doesn't mean that they have no heart.  In fact Dr. Dunbar is quick to criticize techniques that ask trainers to behave like dispassionate laboratory robots.  Instead he believes that we as trainers need to utilize our strengths as humans: our intuition our voice and our relationship with our dogs in order to be the best trainers we can be.  Then we can dispassionately measure and evaluate the results of our training so we can scientifically determine whether or not our methods are effective.  \t  \t  Whether you are a professional dog trainer veterinary clinician shelter worker groomer dog walker or simply a pet owner who is interested in the science of dog training and behavior modification this course will provide you with a wealth of exciting new ideas that you can immediately use to bring about positive change in your life with your dog.  \t  \t  Dr. Dunbar was instrumental in the popularization of dog friendly training methods that are enjoyable for dogs and their owners but also efficient and effective.  You'll learn techniques that are perfectly appropriate for the whole family and designed to produce well-behaved canine companions that are friendly and reliable.    \t  \t  This course consists of 18+ hours worth of video lecture by Dr. Ian Dunbar a set of accompanying notes and 2 eBooks: BEFORE You Get Your Puppy & AFTER You Get Your Puppy",
